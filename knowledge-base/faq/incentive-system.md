# Incentive System

<summary>How to bootstrap network effects on NaoNao?</summary>

More producers attracts more consumers. More consumers attract more producers.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">`extended`</mark>

At first there is one content creator, a single producer. The online events added by this content creator provides the basis for any producer and any consumer to follow after that. The first content indexed on NaoNao must drive enough interest for anyone on the internet to find something valuable on the platform. The goal in the early days is to find another producer or the first consumer to join the community and from there everything will move in some kind of lockstep. The flywheel will spin if some fraction of content creators and premium subscribers can be onboard continuously over time. A little bit here. A little bit there. The assumption for fundamental value accrual here can be described as follows:

* online events have an inherent value
* indexing more online events captures more value
* more value captured convinces more users to subscribe
* more subscriptions imply higher revenue

<summary>How are producers incentivized to create content?</summary>

#### <mark style="color:green;">`oneliner`</mark>

Producers get paid to create content on the NaoNao platform.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">`extended`</mark>

When adding online events to the platform, and when generating engagement on those event links, then content creators can be rewarded by users who want to subscribe to premium features. The decision to fund producers is directly made by the consumers, peer-to-peer. That means users send their subscription fee directly to the content creators they want to reward for their service. Producers get rewarded in pure free market fashion on the NaoNao platform. That allows anyone to be a content creator and get paid, given they provide real value to the platform and its users.&#x20;

<summary>How are consumers incentivized to pay subscription fees?</summary>

#### <mark style="color:green;">`oneliner`</mark>

Consumers consume, in the most convenience and most pleasure maximizing ways.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">`extended`</mark>

The premise of consumption on NaoNao is purely based on the fact that many great online activities can be indexed on the platform. Given that this were to be true, it is fair to say that "if you build it they will come". And then consumers do what consumers do best, they consume. The incentive to pay the subscription fee will become obvious for power users who want to organize the platform's content in ways that match the interests of the individual. Imagine google would transparently allow you to configure the search algorithm based on your needs and wishes, instead of pretending to know you and showing you what they think is right and true amidst the paid advertisements in between. The user can make NaoNao their own without interference of magical algorithms that nobody understands. On NaoNao, you create the lists of online activities that you are interested in. You do that, and nobody else.

<summary>Why are subscription payments peer-to-peer?</summary>

#### <mark style="color:green;">`oneliner`</mark>

Because the free market is the best tool to find truth.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">`extended`</mark>

Individuals making individual decisions allow the NaoNao platform to facilitate value creation based on merit. The user decides what they want to see and do on the platform, and in that spirit they decide who to reward to enable their individual needs. When individuals exchange value in a peer-to-peer fashion, they do always retain full control of their intentions and funds. In Web3 terms that implies trustless and non-custodial transactions that nobody can prevent or interfere with. Anything that is not peer-to-peer is not a free market, is not trustless and is probably not non-custodial. Anything that is not peer-to-peer is more likely to be a honeypot for corruption and exploitation. And we have enough of those system out there in the world.

<summary>How does the onchain reputation system work?</summary>

#### <mark style="color:green;">`oneliner`</mark>

The smart contracts track how often producers receive subscriptions fees.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">`extended`</mark>

When users subscribe for premium features, they are deciding which content creators to reward for their services by sending their subscription fee directly to those selected addresses. The subscription smart contract tracks how often the content creator addresses got funded, effectively creating a productivity matrix, or leaderboard if you will. Knowing which producers got funded how many times enables the platform to understand who creates real value. With these onchain information it becomes possible to allow content creators to e.g. mint an commemorative **NFT** or to effectively distribute an **Airdrop** allocation in the future.&#x20;

The properties of this reputation system are [decently sybil resistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack). While participation is open, free and permissionless for content creators, their reputation comes from real money intentionally spend by real users. Those users for themselves make the choice to reward a content creator based on merit. Arguably an attacker could simply send the subscription fees to themselves. In the process they would forfeit the service fee deducted by the platform. And while the attacker could record themselves as content creator, they could only do that once a month. After one year an attacker could create an onchain reputation for themselves attributing 12 productivity points to their address. In contrast, legitimate content creators are likely to receive orders of magnitude more subscription fees if they created real value to real users. The distribution of funds across the productivity matrix allows the platform to define some kind of threshold that is being considered safe. And while no system is 100%, the amount of time, work, money and consistency required in order to game the system in malicious ways makes the onchain reputation system of the NaoNao platform reasonably well prepared to reward the vast majority of honest actors in the future.

Note that next to the onchain reputation there will exist a fair amount of offchain reputation, because the content platform itself, so far, is running on Web2 rails. This part cannot easily be compromised by external actors.&#x20;
