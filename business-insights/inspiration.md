<summary>Let the Metaverse grow around NaoNao. </summary>

When Jeff Bezos started Amazon, the internet was tiny. Normal people did not even know what the internet was. Regardless, Jeff decided to build Amazon anyway and let the internet grow around it.

The same principle can be applied to NaoNao and the idea of the Metaverse. Normal people do not even know what the Metaverse is, but we can build NaoNao anyway and let the Metaverse grow around it.

<summary>There is no Drama and no Fighting on NaoNao.</summary>

The internet is full of keyboard warriors making snidey comments lighting whole communities on fire. All of this noise dominates our timelines on "social media" causing generations to grow depressed with pessimistic world views. The world is not getting worse. It is just that we somehow highlight a lot of the outrage and negativity, simply because that is what sells a lot of eye balls.

NaoNao was built to have a place in which we can disconnect from the noise and instead dive into a world of online activities and shared experiences. Because people are kinder in person, allowing us to really get to know somebody better. Focussing on the here and now opens up opportunities to discover new ways of living and thinking. All the talk out there is cheap. What matters is what we can do together.
