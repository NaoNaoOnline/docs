<summary>People will always want to find trust in people!</summary>

Human interactions happen on certain terms that build the basis for shared experiences. Arguably _one_, if not _the_ most fundamental term on which interactions are based on, is trust. Trust allows us to lean into a shared experience and grow. People will never not want to have trust in other people.

Trust might mean to be in control. Trust might mean to lean further forward. Trust might mean to be vulnerable. Trust might mean to have permission. Trust might mean to be relied upon. Trust might mean to show yourself. Trust might mean to be competent.

_Why is this north star about trust and not about safety? "Always true" defines an opportunity. Enabling those opportunities is what guides us. Trust is what a magical moment starts with. Safety on the other hand is the resulting outcome of an experience. Managing outcomes instead of opportunities is a regulatory fallacy causing broken mechanism design. The average nation state governments of this world testify to the Sodom and Gomorrah of the human condition. When you let safety guide you, what you create is hell. Because by managing the outcome to be static, you take away the opportunity to grow._

<summary>People will always want to find magic in moments!</summary>

The world is a dark forest. And amidst the dark there are glimmers of light. This light is the magic created within a moment, and people want to experience it. People will never not want to experience magical moments. What is magic is different for every individual, but what is magic, is what is being appreciated, always.&#x20;

Magic might be another person that we meet. Magic might be whatever serendipity throws at us. Magic might be a pleasnt surprise. Magic might be the way an interface works. Magic might be to quickly find what you are looking for. Magic might be to feel whole.
