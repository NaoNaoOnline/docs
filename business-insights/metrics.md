# Metrics

{% hint style="info" %}
Building NaoNao makes certain assumptions about the business model and user behaviour. Below are ideas for Key Performance Indicators that should be monitored in order to inform future adjustments of the roadmap and the platform overall. Note that these metrics or their relevance might change as theories are validated or invalidated over time.

<details>

<summary>The amount of events that users visited before paying for a premium subscription.</summary>

NaoNao has a subscriptions based business model. The theory is that users pay for NaoNao eventually in order to access discovery and organization features like custom lists and list notifications. The user's path towards paying the subscription fee implies that value has been generated by the NaoNao platform, which users then want to increase further. If this theory is correct, then users visit more events before they subscribe. If this theory is incorrect, then users visit a lot of events without ever subscribing.&#x20;

Note that users not visiting any events at all would render this metric and its theory irrelevant, pointing to a more fundamental problem with the idea of NaoNao itself.&#x20;
