More producers attracts more consumers. More consumers attract more producers.

At first there is one content creator, a single producer. The online events added by this content creator provides the basis for any producer and any consumer to follow after that. The first content indexed on NaoNao must drive enough interest for anyone on the internet to find something valuable on the platform. The goal is to find another producer or the first consumer to join the community and from there everything will move in some kind of lockstep. The flywheel will spin if some fraction of content creators and premium subscribers can be onboard continuously over time. A little bit here. A little bit there.

<summary>How does the onchain reputation system work?</summary>

The smart contracts track how often producers receive subscriptions fees.

When users subscribe for premium features, they are deciding which content creators to reward for their services by sending their subscription fee directly to those selected addresses. The subscription smart contract tracks how often the content creator addresses got funded, effectively creating a productivity matrix, or leaderboard if you will. Knowing which producers got funded how many times enables the platform to understand who creates real value. With these onchain information it becomes possible to allow content creators to e.g. mint an commemorative NFT or to effectively distribute an airdrop allocation in the future.&#x20;

The properties of this reputation system are [decently sybil resistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack). While participation is open, free and permissionless for content creators, their reputation comes from real money intentionally spend by real users. Those users for themselves make the choice to reward a content creator based on merit. Arguably an attacker could simply send the subscription fees to themselves. In the process they would forfeit the service fee deducted by the platform. And while the attacker could record themselves as content creator, they could only do that once a month. After one year an attacker could create an onchain reputation for themselves attributing 12 productivity points to their address. In contrast, legitimate content creators are likely to receive orders of magnitude more subscription fees if they created real value to real users. The distribution of funds across the productivity matrix allows the platform to define some kind of threshold that is being considered safe. And while no system is 100%, the amount of time, work, money and consistency required in order to game the system in malicious ways makes the onchain reputation system of the NaoNao platform reasonably well prepared to reward the vast majority of honest actors in the future.&#x20;
