NaoNao takes a service fee from all premium subscriptions.&#x20;

The incentive system on the NaoNao platform is based on Premium Subscriptions. Users subscribe for premium features by directly sending the subscription fee every month to their favourite content creators. The payment process is facilitated by a smart contract deployed on various L2s. When a user pays the subscription fee, the smart contract processing the transaction deducts the NaoNao service fee and forwards the rest of the subscription fee to the selected content creators.

NaoNao creates value by indexing useful online activities.

Indexing online activities effectively means to create and manage a unique data layer for those digital events. In the age of machine learning and autonomous agents, one aspect of unique data layers is that they are extremely valuable. While machine learning models will become commoditized, the data to train them will be the digital equivalent of crude oil. That is to say unique amounts of data is and will be very valuable.

While NaoNao arguably has not much to offer to users in the early days apart from organizational features within a web frontend, future interfaces aim to be conversational, individualized and trusworthy. The ideal interface for NaoNao will be similar to experiences that [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and [Bard](https://bard.google.com/chat) offer today. Being able to simply talk to your personal agent whenever you want to dive into the metaverse and enjoyed globally shared experiences will one day become the norm. And NaoNao will be at the centre of this transformation. The potential to capture value throughout this transformation is massive, and all actors and participants will be rewarded and thrive based on the roles they chose for themselves along this journey.
